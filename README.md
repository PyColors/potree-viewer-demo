# Potree Viewer demo

## Description

This app shows Potree Viewer in action with some point clouds into it.

## Installation

Due to strict security policies in browsers, it is not possible to open potree html files directly on your pc because potree needs permission to load files.

Let's run a node.js server with.

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the server

```bash
# development - http://localhost:8022
$ npm run start-server
```
